I am a researcher deeply passionate about creating a platform that facilitates both human care and deep interactions within our society. I strongly believe that every human being needs deep and caring interaction with others. Unfortunately, many individuals in modern society lack these interactions, leading to isolation and loneliness. My research focuses on developing platforms through the integration of mobile-IoT technology and social science perspectives to foster these interactions. I am particularly interested in platforms that connect individuals in need with the right caregivers. Additionally, I focus on enabling ordinary individuals to provide advanced and effective caregiving and helping people engage in deeper interactions in their daily lives. The relationships that I am focusing on include those within church communities, volunteer groups, mentor-mentee dynamics, and parent-child relationships. I am currently a PhD student at the KAIST School of Computing under the guidance of Professor Junhwa Song.
